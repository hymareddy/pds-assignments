This repository contains the solution for Assignment 1, which is divided into two main parts:

Frailty Study Case (Female Participants):

Ingest, process, and analyze grip strength and frailty data.

Preprocessing steps include unit standardization, feature engineering, and categorical encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) includes summary statistics and correlation analysis between grip strength and frailty.

Student Performance Dataset Visualizations:

Ingestion and preprocessing (handling missing values, standardization).

Five required visualizations (V1â€“V5) with interpretations:

V1: Gender differences in math vs reading

V2: Test prep impact on math

V3: Lunch type vs overall performance

V4: Subject correlations (math, reading, writing)

V5: Math vs reading with trend lines by test prep
