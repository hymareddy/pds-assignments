## 📄 Assignment Overview

### **Q1 – Used Cars Dataset (Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering)**

This section includes:

* Loading the used car dataset from the provided Box link
* Handling missing values (median/mode imputation)
* Removing units from numeric variables (`kmpl`, `CC`, `bhp`, `Lakh`)
* One-hot encoding (`Fuel_Type`, `Transmission`)
* Creating an additional predictor (e.g., `Car_Age`)
* Performing transformations similar to R `dplyr`:

  * `select`, `filter`, `rename`, `mutate`, `arrange`, `summarize + group_by`

All steps are fully implemented in **Q1_UsedCars.ipynb**.

### **Q2 – Diabetes Dataset (Sampling & Bootstrap Analysis)**

This section includes:

* Reading the Diabetes dataset from the provided Box link
* Drawing a sample of 25 observations and comparing Glucose statistics
* Computing the 98th percentile of BMI for both sample and population
* Performing **bootstrap sampling (500 samples of size n=150)** for:

  * mean BloodPressure
  * standard deviation
  * percentile
* Comparing bootstrap estimates with population values
* Visualizations for sampling and bootstrap distributions

All steps are fully implemented in **Q2_Diabetes.ipynb**.
